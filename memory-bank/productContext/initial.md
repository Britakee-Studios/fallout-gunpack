# Product Context - Fallout Gunpack

## Why This Project Exists
The Fallout Gunpack brings the iconic weapons from Fallout 4 into Minecraft, allowing players to experience wasteland-style combat in their survival worlds. This NeoForge port ensures the addon remains accessible to the NeoForge community on the latest Minecraft versions.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Mod Loader Gap:** Original gunpack was for Fabric/older Forge; this provides NeoForge 1.21.1 support
2. **Content Enhancement:** Adds thematic, high-quality weapons to TaCZ's gun system
3. **Fallout Experience:** Brings authentic Fallout 4 aesthetics and mechanics to Minecraft
4. **Complete Crafting:** Provides balanced recipes so items aren't just creative-mode only

## How It Should Work
### Player Experience
1. **Discovery:** Players install the mod alongside TaCZ
2. **Crafting:** Players craft weapons, ammo, and attachments at Gun Smith Table
3. **Combat:** Players use Fallout-themed weapons with authentic sounds and animations
4. **Progression:** Advanced weapons (Gauss Rifle, lasers) require more valuable materials

### Technical Operation
- Loads as TaCZ addon (not datapack extraction)
- All items registered through TaCZ's index system
- Recipes integrated with Gun Smith Table
- Sounds, textures, and animations loaded from resource pack structure
- Bilingual support for international audience

## User Experience Goals
### Immediate Goals (Achieved)
- ✅ Smooth installation (single JAR file)
- ✅ All weapons functional with proper sounds/animations
- ✅ Balanced crafting recipes for sustainability
- ✅ Language support for accessibility

### Quality Standards
- **Authenticity:** Weapons should feel like Fallout 4 counterparts
- **Balance:** Recipes should be challenging but fair
- **Polish:** No missing textures, sounds, or broken references
- **Compatibility:** Work seamlessly with base TaCZ features

### Design Philosophy
- **Thematic Materials:** Energy weapons use redstone/glowstone, ballistic use gunpowder
- **Rarity Scaling:** More powerful weapons (Gauss Rifle) require rarer materials
- **Cross-Mod Compatible:** Uses common tags (c:ingots/iron) for mod interoperability
- **Faithful Adaptation:** Maintains Fallout aesthetic while fitting Minecraft mechanics
